Cover letter
Hi, I'm a software engineer and React developer with strong experience in developing real-time AUDIO/VIDEO streaming platforms web-based APIs and services such as AGORA 3./4.x, RTMP, Socket.io, HTTP/2.0, ATSC, Twilio, etc.

Quickly, I can review the existing Agora-based MVP, and provide specific and critical suggestions on how to improve your project (MVP) performance and ensure it will be easy to maintain for future revisions.

Let's talk soon.

Describe your recent experience with similar projects
Recently, I built a prototype MVP of a video/audio/chat streaming software for tendom.tv company using React.js, Next.js, Node.js, AGORA 3.0, RTC/RTM SDKs, and firebase.

Describe your approach to testing and improving QA
Review recent defect hotspots and identify at-risk features or functionality. Implement End-to-end testing using selenium or other testing scripting engines. Slowly ramp up unit testing as new functions are added to ensure that no breaking changes are added.

Create scripts that are linked to checks using husky or another tool that triggers on check-ins. Add GitHub actions (depending on your hosting provider) to run checks on PR creation and periodic checks to ensure production issues are proactively caught.

Along with any testing updates review related documentation and update. For backend APIs use swagger or another live documentation framework that allows linking between API documentation and execution to help with understanding.

A key aspect of ensuring QA's effectiveness is to include the leads in feature discussions so they can understand the new features and have time to plan out test cases. Also, each run of a test should be recorded separately so that upon completion of a testing cycle an evaluation can be completed to understand which area of the code needs more detailed testing and/or support via a post-mortem.

Tools like jest/mocha/storybook/pytest and other testing automation help keep programmers honest and allow QA to focus on critical feature areas ensuring they are able to be effective and make good use of their time.
